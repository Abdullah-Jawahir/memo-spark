# Study Tracking Implementation

This document outlines the implementation of study tracking features in MemoSpark.

## Components Created

1. **StudyTimer Component**
   - Located at: `src/components/study/StudyTimer.tsx`
   - Purpose: Tracks study time for each session and individual flashcards
   - Features: Accurate time tracking with start/stop functionality

2. **StudyStatsPanel Component**
   - Located at: `src/components/study/StudyStatsPanel.tsx`
   - Purpose: Displays overall study statistics retrieved from the backend
   - Features: Visual representation of study metrics with categorized views (today, week, overall)

3. **Study Tracking Utilities**
   - Located at: `src/utils/studyTracking.ts`
   - Purpose: Provides utilities for interacting with study tracking APIs
   - Features:
     - Session management (start/end)
     - Review recording
     - LocalStorage caching

## API Integration

1. **API Endpoints Added**:
   - `/api/study/start-session`: Initializes a new study session
   - `/api/study/record-review`: Logs individual flashcard reviews with ratings and time spent
   - `/api/study/stats`: Retrieves study statistics
   - `/api/study/recent-activity`: Gets recent study activity (for future implementation)

2. **Study Session Flow**:
   - Session starts automatically when a user begins studying
   - Each flashcard review is tracked individually with:
     - Rating (again, hard, good, easy)
     - Study time in seconds
     - Associated with the current session

## User Experience Improvements

1. **Real-time Timer**:
   - Displays active study time during the session
   - Updates automatically as the user progresses

2. **Statistics Dashboard**:
   - Shows detailed study metrics
   - Provides insights into study habits and progress

3. **Session Completion**:
   - Summary of completed session with stats
   - Option to view detailed statistics

## Integration with Dashboard

The dashboard will automatically update to reflect the latest study progress when:

1. A study session is completed
2. The user navigates back to the dashboard after studying
3. The dashboard is refreshed

## Future Enhancements

1. Additional metrics and visualizations
2. Study streak tracking
3. Goal-setting features
4. Learning analytics
